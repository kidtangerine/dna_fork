DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT) is a powerful, database-driven system for tracking NA meetings.
It is NOT an official product of NA ( http://na.org ). Rather, it is a project designed and implemented by
NA members, and meant to be used by official NA Service bodies.

This project is a Drupal module that implements a client, or "satellite." It will allow you to connect to
a central "root" server, and display meeting searches in a Drupal installation.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The project requires a functioning BMLT root server ( http://magshare.org/blog/installing-the-root-server/ ).
It does not implement a root server, but connects to an existing one.
It requires PHP 5.0 or above.

This module depends upon the BMLT Satellite Base Class Project (included as a submodule). The GitHub repository
for that module is at:

    https://github.com/MAGSHARE/BMLT-Satellite-Base-Class

INSTALLATION
------------

You install the 'bmlt-6.x-' or 'bmlt-7.x-' directory in /sites/all/modules/ (You may need to create the "modules"
directory).
Enable the module in the usual manner.
This module operates through the use of text filters/input formats. You need to set up a text filter that uses the
"Add a BMLT instance inline in text" filter.

CHANGELIST
----------
2.2.2 -
    - May 13, 2012
    - Fixed a nasty bug in the admin interface that could create multiple empty settings.
    
2.2.1 -
    - March 28, 2012
    - Adds an alert to the new map search, informing the user when no meetings are found.
    
2.2 -
    - December 31, 2011
    - Introduces some fixes for validation errors in the new map search.
    - Removed some errant CSS.
    - Now strip out the [[bmlt_mobile]] shortcode if the page is not a mobile page. This allows the shortcode to be used, as the comment version is stripped by "code cleaners."
    
2.1.24
    - Fixes a JavaScript Error with the new map search on Internet Explorer.
    
2.1.23
    - Improved some of the basic styles in the new map search info windows.
    
2.1.22
	- Addresses a bug in Mozilla Firefox, that prevents the use of the popup menus in the multi-day (red) map icons.

2.1.21
    - Fixes a couple of minor theme/style issues.
    - Mitigates a strange Firefox bug that caused weird page loads when closing the location area.

2.1.20
    - Added the new shortcode "bmlt_map." Very useful.
                
2.1.19
    - Addressed a condition that could result in warnings if the error level is set to ERR_ALL

2.1.18
    - Now have the bmlt_changes shortcode.

2.1.17
    - Refactored the shared code into a submodule.

2.1.16
    - Added some more data to the displays for meeting info in the mobile client.
    
2.1.15
    - Reformatted the two Drupal-specific files to use Drupal coding standards.
    
2.1.14
    - Fixed a very strange bug that seems to cause error 500s on some servers. Not sure why the fix worked, but it does. This only manifested when doing an "address only" search in mobile mode.

2.1.13
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the Contact US form from being displayed.

2.1.12
    - Replaced a nice, efficient 'implode' with a primitive, kludgy loop, because Drupal 7 thinks implode() deserves a coding warning.
    - Did a bit of code cleanup to make the Coder module happy-ish.

2.1.11 -May 8, 2011
    - Fixed an error in the parameter loads that interfered with advanced search functions.
    
2.1.10 -May 7, 2011
    - Fixed a JavaScript error that prevented saves.
